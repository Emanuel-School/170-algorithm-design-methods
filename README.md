# Designing Algorithms

This repository contains resources for the **Designing Algorithms** module of Stage 6 Software Engineering. Students are expected to download, complete, and organise these tasks in their own working repositories using the IDE of their choice (e.g. PyCharm, JupyterLab, WebStorm).

## Structure

- **operations-manual/**: Authoritative reference on algorithm design strategies.
- **training/**: Microlabs for developing skills in decomposition, pseudocode, and structure.
- **simulation/**: A macrolab challenge to integrate and apply your algorithm design skills.
- **clearance/**: Assessment-style review tasks for checking logic and flow.
- **mission/**: A major design task involving full decomposition and refinement.
- **debrief/**: A structured reflection task to evaluate your approach and thinking.
- **reference/**: Supplementary material including pseudocode conventions and formatting guidelines.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the files you need.
2. Work locally using your preferred IDE or notebook environment.
3. Save your progress in your own GitHub repository.
4. Use the `operations-manual/` as your go-to reference for decomposition, desk checking, and structure charts.

## Licence

Materials are provided for educational use only within the Stage 6 Software Engineering curriculum.
