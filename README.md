# 1.7 Algorithm Design Methods

This repository contains resources for the [1.7 Algorithm design methods](https://conceptstocode.apolloacademy.au/1.7-algorithm-design-methods) Stage 6 HSC Software Engineering textbook [Concepts to Code: Beginning Software Engineering](https://conceptstocode.apolloacademy.au/). 

Students should download, complete, and organise these tasks in their own working repositories using the IDE of their choice (e.g. PyCharm, JupyterLab, WebStorm, Visual Studio, etc.)

## Structure

- **operations-manual/**: Authoritative reference on algorithm design strategies.
- **training/**: Microlabs for developing skills in decomposition, pseudocode, and structure.
- **simulation/**: A macrolab challenge to integrate and apply your algorithm design skills.
- **clearance/**: Assessment-style review tasks for checking logic and flow.
- **mission/**: A major design task involving full decomposition and refinement.
- **debrief/**: A structured reflection task to evaluate your approach and thinking.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the files you need. This can also be done directly from the textbook.
2. Work locally using your preferred IDE or notebook environment.
3. Save your progress in your own GitHub repository.
4. Use the Manual in the textbook as your go-to reference for decomposition, desk checking, and structure charts.
