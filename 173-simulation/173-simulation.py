# 173 Simulation: Basic Password Checker

"""
Your task:
- Ask the user to enter a password.
- Check if it meets the following requirements:
    * At least 8 characters long
    * Contains at least one digit
    * Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Provide feedback on which checks passed or failed.
- Allow up to 3 attempts; if all fail, display a lockout message.

Instructions:
- Write pseudocode (with BEGIN and END) before starting your code.
- Design and implement the logic using clear control structures.
- Test your program with different inputs.
- Add comments explaining key sections of your code.
