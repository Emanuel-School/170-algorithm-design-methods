# 173 Simulation: Basic Password Checker

In this Simulation, you will design and implement a **basic password checker** using algorithm design methods you have learned so far.

## Purpose

This Simulation challenges you to:
- Practise structured algorithm design using decomposition and pseudocode
- Use control structures effectively (sequence, selection, repetition)
- Develop, test, and improve a Python program that meets specific functional requirements
- Reflect on your design and testing process

## Task Overview

You are to write a Python program that:
- Asks the user to enter a password
- Checks if the password:
  * Is at least 8 characters long
  * Contains at least one digit
  * Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Provides feedback on which checks passed or failed
- Allows up to 3 attempts before locking the user out

## Deliverables

- Pseudocode (with BEGIN and END) for your design (include in comments or a separate file)
- Completed Python program (`173-simulation.py`) using the scaffold provided
- Reflection (either as comments or in a separate `reflection.md` file) addressing:
  - How you designed the program
  - What challenges you faced and how you solved them
  - How you tested your program

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the Simulation folder.
2. Open the scaffold file `173-simulation.py`.
3. Complete the TODOs in the scaffold, writing your solution.
4. Test your program with different inputs.
5. Commit and push your final solution and reflection to your personal repository.

Good luck! Apply your structured design thinking and show your best work.
